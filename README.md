For this web application the user is tasked with completing a short quiz within the given 75 second time window.

For tracking and potential reuse, the application also intends to store scores by initials.

Upon opening the application the user is first shown a "Start Screen" such as the below:
<img width="1058" alt="Screen Shot 2019-10-12 at 10 02 16 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31483933/66711215-8b283700-ed3c-11e9-82f2-b8efe4d0d32b.png">

After clicking the "Start" button, the user is then shown a series of questions and prompted to answer as the clock winds down - additional time is removed as wrong answers are submitted.

Though I was able to replicated the start screen, I had difficulties getting the click events to register at times and is noticeable for users attempting to complete the quiz.
